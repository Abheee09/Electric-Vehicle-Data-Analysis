# Electric Vehicle Population Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of over 150,000 electric vehicle (EV) records to uncover trends in adoption, market share, and performance metrics. Using tools like Excel for preprocessing and Tableau for visualization, the project provides actionable insights into the electric vehicle landscape.

## Objectives
- **Analyze EV adoption trends** by year and geographic distribution.
- **Evaluate market share** of leading EV manufacturers, highlighting dominance and competitive performance.
- **Examine electric range performance** across vehicle types (BEV vs. PHEV).
- **Create interactive dashboards** for easier insights and decision-making.

## Key Insights
- **EV Types**: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) account for 77.6% of the dataset, while Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) represent 22.4%.
- **Adoption Growth**: EV registrations peaked in 2023, with 37,079 new registrations, indicating accelerating growth.
- **Regional Trends**: King County leads with 52% of total EV registrations in the dataset.
- **Manufacturer Dominance**: Tesla holds a 45.9% market share, followed by Nissan (9.0%) and Chevrolet (8.0%).
- **Electric Range**: The mean electric range is 67.88 miles, with the highest range recorded at 337 miles.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Data Processing**: Microsoft Excel
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau
- **Key Metrics**: Adoption trends, regional distribution, market share, and electric range analysis

## Tableau Dashboards
- **Adoption Trends**: Line chart showcasing annual EV growth.
